                <Typography sx={{ mb: 1 }}>
                    At its most basic, <strong>a chord</strong> is a group of notes played together at the same time. Most commonly, chords use three or four notes â€” but they can include any number (the more, the jazzier).
                    What shapes a chordâ€™s quality and character is the distance between its notes, known as <em>intervals</em>.

                <Typography sx={{ mb: 1 }}>
                    One of the most common chord types is the <strong>triad</strong>, made up of:

                <Box component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3 }}>
                    <li><strong>Root</strong>: the main note the chord is named after.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third</strong>: helps define whether the chord sounds major or minor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fifth</strong>: adds stability and fullness to the chord.</li>
                </Box>
                <Typography sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
                    For example, a <strong>C major triad</strong> contains the notes C (root), E (major third), and G (perfect fifth).

                    Chords form the harmonic foundation of most Western music, shaping emotional tone and musical movement.
                    But the idea of combining notes â€” whether for harmony, color, or texture â€” exists in many musical traditions worldwide, each with its own approach.

                <Typography sx={{ mb: 1 }}>
                    An <strong>inversion</strong> happens when the notes in a chord are rearranged so that a note other than the root is in the lowest (bass) position.
                    The harmonic identity stays the same, but the <em>voicing</em> changes.

                <Box component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3 }}>

                    <li><strong>2nd Inversion</strong>: the fifth is the lowest note.</li>
                    <li><strong>3rd Inversion</strong> (for 7th chords): the seventh is the lowest note.</li>

                    Do All Musical Cultures Use Chords?
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
                    In <strong>Western music</strong> â€” particularly from the Baroque era through Classical, Romantic, and into jazz and pop â€” chords are central.
                    Harmony is often created by stacking intervals into <strong>triads</strong> and extended chords, then organizing them into progressions that give music direction, emotion, and resolution.
                    This approach to harmony, based on <strong>vertical structures</strong> and <strong>functional relationships</strong> between chords, has become a core feature of how Western music is written, taught, and analyzed.
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
                    But not all musical cultures build harmony this way. Many create rich musical experiences using entirely different systems â€” some without chords at all.
                    Harmony can emerge from <strong>melody</strong>, <strong>texture</strong>, <strong>rhythm</strong>, or <strong>timbre</strong>, rather than from stacked notes played simultaneously.
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
                    In much of <strong>sub-Saharan African music</strong>, for example, harmony is often the result of <strong>interlocking melodic patterns</strong> and <strong>layered rhythms</strong>.
                    Multiple vocal or instrumental lines may be played simultaneously, each with its own rhythmic phrasing or contour, creating a dense, textured soundscape.
                    Rather than relying on fixed chord progressions, this music often emphasizes <strong>cyclical structure</strong>, <strong>call and response</strong>, and <strong>polyrhythmic interaction</strong> â€” producing harmony as a natural outcome of musical dialogue and community participation.
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
                    In <strong>Indian classical music</strong>, harmony is approached differently again: the <strong>drone</strong> establishes a tonal center while the melodic line explores the <strong>raga</strong> â€” a scale with emotional and cultural meaning.
                    Chord changes are absent; instead, <strong>tension and release</strong> unfold over time through pitch, rhythm, and ornamentation.
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
                    In <strong>traditional East Asian music</strong>, such as Chinese or Japanese classical traditions, harmony often plays a subtle role.
                    The focus may be on <strong>melody</strong>, <strong>mode</strong>, or <strong>timbre</strong>, with parallel lines or <strong>heterophonic textures</strong> rather than stacked chords.
                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
                    So while chords are essential in many Western styles, they are not a universal requirement for making expressive, complex, or emotionally powerful music.
                    Across cultures, harmony can be built in many ways â€” not just vertically through chords, but also through <strong>horizontal movement</strong>, <strong>rhythmic layering</strong>, or <strong>tonal resonance</strong>.
